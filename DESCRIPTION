Description: This package is intented to implement all the features of 
    Statistical Implicative Analysis. This theory aims at building association 
    rules of the form : if an object has the property A it also tends to have 
    the property B. The SIA builds confidence of rules by computing the number 
    of counter examples of such an rule and then by measuring the surprise 
    (or the probability) to have so few counter examples compared to the number 
    of counter examples we would have with two random variables have the same 
    sizes (than A and B). With Rchic you can build a similirity tree (using 
    similarity analysis), an implicative graph and a hierarchical tree.
