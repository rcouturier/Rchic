Description: This package is intented to implement all the features of
    Regis Gras' Statistical Implicative Analysis (SIA). This theory aims at 
    building association rules of the form "if an object hold property A 
    it also tends to hold property B". SIA computes the strength of the rules 
    by counting the number of counterexamples to the rule, and measuring the 
    surprise as the probability of finding so few counterexamples as the 
    observed ones, under an assumption of independence between A and B, 
    taking their sizes into account. With 'rchic' you can build a similirity tree 
    (using similarity analysis), an implicative graph and a hierarchical tree.
